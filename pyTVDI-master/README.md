# pyTVDI

## Synopsis

This project contains *Python* code for computing the *Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index* 
for assessing soil moisture and evaporative fraction with remote sensing data combining 
a vegetation index and radiometric surface temperature. 

The project consists of: 

1. lower-level modules with the basic functions needed in TVDI calculation. 

2. higher-level scripts for easily running **pyTVDI** from imagery.

## Installation

Download the project to your local system, enter the download directory and then type

`python setup.py install`. 

if you want to install **pyTVDI** and its low-level modules in your Python distribution. 

The following Python libraries will be required for running pyTVDI:

- Numpy
- GDAL

## Code Example
### High-level example

The easiest way to get a feeling of **pyTVDI** and its configuration is through the provided ipython/jupyter notebooks. 
In a terminal shell, navigate to your working folder and type

- `jupyter notebook TVDIgui.ipynb`. 

In addition, you can also run **TVDI** with the scripts *MAIN_TVDI.py*, 
which will read an input configuration file (defaults are *Config_TVDI.txt*). 
You can edit these configuration files or make a copy to fit your data and site characteristics and either run any of 
these two scripts in a Python GUI or in a terminal shell:

- `python MAIN_TVDI.py <configuration file>.`.
> where \<configuration file> points to a customized configuration file... leave it blank if you want to use the default 
file *Config_TVDI.txt*.


### Low-level example
You can obtain TVDI/EF images by importing the module *tvdi*, which contains all the methods for estimating the dry 
and wet edges and computing TVDI or Evaporative Fraction.

```python
import pyTVDI 
output=pyTVDI.tvdi(io_inf, roi_inf, alg_inf)
```

You can type
`help(pyTVDI.tvdi)`
to understand better the inputs needed and the outputs returned

   
## Basic Contents
### High-level modules
- *.src/pyTVDI.py*, class object for TSEB scripting.
- *TVDI_GUI.ipynb* notebook for using pyTVDI and configuring TSEB through a Graphical User Interface, GUI.
- *MAIN_TVDI.py*, high level scripts for running TVDI through a configuration file (*Config_TVDI.txt*).

### Low-level module
The low-level module in this project is aimed at providing customisation and more flexibility in running the Ts-VI triangle method. 
The following modules are included

- *.src/pyTVDI.py*.
> core functions for running **TVDI**.

## Tests
The folder *./Input* contains examples for running **pyTVDI**. Just run the high-level scripts with the configuration files 
provided by default and compare the resulting outputs with the files stored in *./Output/*
